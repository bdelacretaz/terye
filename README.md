# Terye?
The name is pronouced like "terrier" in "Jack Russell Terrier".

I was looking for a name that contains JCR, Jack Russell came to mind but
it's already taken, the name Terye is less popular (so far!) on the Web.

# Related projects
[Apache Sling] (http://sling.apache.org), a JCR-based Web framework that we'll use to test and validate Terye.

[Apache Jackrabbit] (http://jackrabbit.apache.org), the JCR reference implementation, that Sling uses by default.

[Jackrabbit Oak] (http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/), next generation content repository, has some overlap with
Terye but is meant to built a production-ready content repository. Terye is clearly meant as an experimental project, in the 
sense of exploring the up and downsides of using off-the-shelf components only.
